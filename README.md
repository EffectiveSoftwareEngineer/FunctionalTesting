Accompanying source code for "**Effective software engineering: Functional Testing**" book and the [substack series](https://effectiveengineer.substack.com/p/coming-soon).

The intent of this code is to demonstrate an automation of functional testing at Unit, Integration and System level.
For that purpose there **will be** at least two HTTP API services with accompanying tests.
